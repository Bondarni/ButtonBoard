Why didn't they label these???

Don't you hate it when you're running maintenance on some yokel's homemade vessel, and they don't bother to fill you in on their genius ship schematic that only lives in their head?  So you have to stumble along their console until you figure out what's what?
Me neither; I love it!
Figure out what the buttons do, and label them.
I love this job.
